# Agile Brazil's website

This is the code repository for [Agile Brazil's website](http://www.agilebrazil.com/). We are currently working on the 2015 conference, but we aim on reusing this struture for future and maybe sister conferences. Because of internationalization and other minor reasons, we use NodeJS, and setting up the development environment is pretty straightforward:

## Getting Started

### Install NodeJS

The current version we are using is NodeJS 0.12.x. You can either install it by downloading it from [their website](https://nodejs.org/download/) or, on Ubuntu 14 we have used [NodeSource's tutorial](https://nodesource.com/blog/nodejs-v012-iojs-and-the-nodesource-linux-repositories) instructions with success:

```bash
# TL;DR
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

### Get this project running

**Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account, by clicking on the Fork button on GitHub.

Then, clone the new repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:[YourUserName]/siteAb2015.git
$ cd siteAb2015

# Install NPM dependencies
$ npm install

$ npm start
```

## Build Static HTML

The idea of ​​this is boilerplate also generate a static HTML pages generated by all Node.js. For that use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) and run Grunt task:

```bash
$ grunt build
```

The "build" directory is where will all static HTML generated by this boilerplate along with the assets files (JavaScript, CSS and Images). The .htaccess file is responsible for doing the rewrite your URL's assets.

## Contributing

Fork our project and use [Pull Requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing) for contributions. This is the checklist for successful pull requests:

- Your code is clean and follow HTML5 semantics;
- You have made small and cohesive commits;
- It works both on mobile and desktop versions;
- All texts have #ptBR and #en i18n;
- It follows our (to-be-written) styleguide.
